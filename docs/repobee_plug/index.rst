``repobee-plug`` Developer Documentation
========================================

``repobee-plug`` is a package for creating plugins for `RepoBee
<https://github.com/repobee/repobee>`_. If you just want to use plugins
created by others, then you're in the wrong place and should head over to
:ref:`plugins`. If you want to create plugins, you are in precisely the right
place! I recommend you read through all of the general documentation, and then
refer to the parts of the module reference that you need for your plugin.

Don't hesitate to get in touch if you need help, you can use the `issue tracker
<https://github.com/repobee/repobee>`_ or find `contact details on the official
web site <https://repobee.org/contact.html>`_.
